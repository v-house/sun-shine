Helping my friends in any situation. 2. Having a family and having fun.Reason for the passion of joining Sunshine: I have faced many bad situations in my life and have hit the rock bottom and came out of it all by myself. And I know how traumatising it is if you have to deal with all of that on your own. So I want to be the guy that I didn't get when I was low and needed someone the most.",
